# Banana Catcher
> A game of bananas... and catching!


### :banana: What is this even?!

<div style="text-align: center;" title="Banana Catcher"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9Ma2wii.png"></div>

This is simple, touch-based game for the iPhone, written in Xcode and Swift 2! It currently supports all models from iPhone 4s and up. ...and, it's completely bananas!


##### It's also my very first app!
After almost 6 months of coding, my hobby project of 2015 is finally finished, and out on the App Store. This has certainly been an amazing learning experience with it's fair share of fun and frustration... and of course, finally, a great sense of achievement to have my very own app available on the App Store for everyone to try out! I basically learned the Swift programming language through the creation of this app, and I must admit that this has been one of the most enjoyable learning experiences of my life! :smile:

### :banana: Go try it out

I am very excited (and anxious) to see what people think, so if you do try it out, I would love to hear from you! Any form of feedback is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions or thoughts about the game, feel free to leave me a review or comment on iTunes / App Store, or shoot me an email at: banana.catcher.feedback@gmail.com

### :banana: A small preview

Here's a small animated preview.

Played around with some of the sprites I used in the game, and tried to recreate the feel of the gameplay through some frame-by-frame animation. :monkey:

### :banana: Sharing my code
When I started this project I knew next to nothing about coding in Swift (not to mention creating a whole game in this new language), and I would have appreciated having similar examples to learn from. So with that in mind, I'm leaving all of my code here, to serve as some form of reference or learning material for anyone in the same shoes that I was in a few months back. Feel free to look through the code and play around with it as much as you want. I hope it can be useful as a small example. (Please don't plagarize :sweat_smile:)

And of course, I would appreciate advice, critique, random comments, and/or any form of feedback to my code as well.

### :banana: Sharing my experience
I've written a short blog post, where I go through my thoughts and experiences around making this game. Here I give a brief overview of the challenges that I found the most fun and interesting during the whole process.
